# Classification-Predicting-Customer-Churn
Data classification project
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on their past behavior and demographic information. The dataset used in this project includes customer data such as demographics, usage patterns, customer service interactions, and more. We will use a classification algorithm to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on this data.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Scikit-learn
6. Matplotlib
7. Seaborn
## Getting started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip or conda.
3. Open the customer_churn.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, analyze the data, and build a predictive model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the model and make predictions on new data.
## Project structure
i. customer_churn.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for this project.
ii. data.csv: Dataset used in this project.
## Data preprocessing
In the data preprocessing step, we will clean the data, handle missing values, and transform variables. We will also create new variables or features that may be relevant to predicting customer churn.

## Exploratory data analysis
In the exploratory data analysis step, we will explore the data to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies. We will also visualize the data using various plots and graphs to gain insights into customer behavior.

## Model selection
In the model selection step, we will choose a classification algorithm that is appropriate for the data and problem. This may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

## Model training
In the model training step, we will train the selected model on a subset of the data.

## Model evaluation
In the model evaluation step, we will evaluate the performance of the model using a validation set. We will assess the accuracy of the model and identify areas for improvement.

## Hyperparameter tuning
In the hyperparameter tuning step, we will tune the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance.

## Model deployment
In the model deployment step, we will deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data. This may involve integrating the model into a web application or other software system.

## Conclusion
By following these steps and leveraging the power of machine learning, we can develop accurate and reliable predictions that can help businesses retain their customers and improve their bottom line.
